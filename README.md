# Unique Viewed Time Viewer
This is a project to take viewed fragments and create a visual timeline of unique viewed time by a user of a video.

## Running the Application

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This will also install the NPM package manager.

  - While you can technically still use NPM, you may encounter version conflicts with some packages. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51203500/difference-between-package-json-package-lock-json-and-yarn-lock-files) for a more detailed explanation.
  - If you're used to NPM, here's a [cheat sheet](https://shift.infinite.red/npm-vs-yarn-cheat-sheet-8755b092e5cc) to translate between the two.
- Install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki). `yarn global add @angular/cli`
